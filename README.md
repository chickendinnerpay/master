What is ChickenDinner?
----------------

ChickenDinner is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. ChickenDinner uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. ChickenDinner Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of
the ChickenDinner Core software, see http://www.chickendinnerpay.org.
